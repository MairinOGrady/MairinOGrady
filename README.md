# Hi, I’m @MairinOGrady
## About Me
I use GitHub to collaborate on projects with other volunteers and technical writers. I am currently a full-time college student studying English Literature and Economics. I am pursuing a career where my technical communication and analytical skills will be in support of business, and I aim to provide innovation and technological/organizational problem-solving to each project. In my free time, I enjoy writing stories, watching movies, and cooking.
## Projects
I am currently a @PubInv volunteer and edit GitHub readme pages for their open-source engineering projects, such as the [VentMon](https://github.com/PubInv/ventmon-ventilator-inline-test-monitor) and the [GPAD](https://github.com/PubInv/general-purpose-alarm-device). Recently, I have also created an [OSMS file repository](https://github.com/PubInv/OSMS-OKHs) in TOML as the beginning step of an open-source project database.
## Publication Support
I am excited to announce that a paper I proofread and formatted for @RobertLRead was recently published! The GPAD is a great device to be featured on HardwareX. Check it out: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468067224000841](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468067224000841).

Another article I edited and proofread was just published! Check out the PolyVentilator: [https://www.hardware-x.com/article/S2468-0672(24)00109-3/fulltext](https://www.hardware-x.com/article/S2468-0672(24)00109-3/fulltext).
## Articles
I wrote an article for The Cor Chronicle about nuclear fusion [https://thecorchronicle.com/2024/03/19/nothings-quiet-on-the-fusion-front/](https://thecorchronicle.com/2024/03/19/nothings-quiet-on-the-fusion-front/) that has over 600 views! I really enjoyed researching the topic while writing, and I'm glad I could contribute to the website.
