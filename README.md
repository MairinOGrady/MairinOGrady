# Hi, I’m @MairinOGrady
## About Me
I use GitHub to collaborate on projects with other volunteers and technical writers. Currently a full-time college student studying English Literature, I am a member of the on-campus Writers' Guild and student-run newspaper. I aim to pursue a career in technical writing and business, supporting innovation and technological/organizational problem-solving. In my free time, I enjoy writing stories, watching movies, and cooking.
## Projects
I am currently a @PubInv volunteer and edit GitHub pages for their open-source engineering projects, such as the [VentMon](https://github.com/PubInv/ventmon-ventilator-inline-test-monitor) and the [GPAD](https://github.com/PubInv/general-purpose-alarm-device).
